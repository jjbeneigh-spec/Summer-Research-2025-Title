This repository is for my Undergraduate Research at the Office of Institutional Research and Analytics at Bucknell University. I worked on two different projects during this time; building predictive models to better understand the reasons behind student enrollment decisions and leveraging generative AI to enhance qualitative surveying research.

## Project 1: 

### Using Data Science to Support the Student Success Journey: Admission

#### The Decision to Enroll: Understanding Factors Shaping Student Path to Enrollment

### Abstract: 
Throughout this research, our team processed data from millions of applicants to better understand the reasons behind student enrollment decisions. The study aims to identify key factors that influence students’ choice to attend our university, and further create a model that will support our admissions to support future students on their admission journey. This poster outlines our methodology, including decisions made during data processing, feature engineering, and model development. We employed advanced techniques to handle imbalanced data and applied hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. As a result, our models achieved high precision and F1 scores, enabling accurate predictions of enrollment across various stages of the admissions process. These insights will help us proactively improve the admissions experience and foster stronger connections with prospective students.
