This repository is for my Undergraduate Research at the Office of Institutional Research and Analytics at Bucknell University. I worked on two different projects during this time; building predictive models to better understand the reasons behind student enrollment decisions and leveraging generative AI to enhance qualitative surveying research.

## Project 1: 

### Using Data Science to Support the Student Success Journey: Admission

#### The Decision to Enroll: Understanding Factors Shaping Student Path to Enrollment

### Abstract: 
Throughout this research, our team processed data from millions of applicants to better understand the reasons behind student enrollment decisions. The study aims to identify key factors that influence students’ choice to attend our university, and further create a model that will support our admissions to support future students on their admission journey. This poster outlines our methodology, including decisions made during data processing, feature engineering, and model development. We employed advanced techniques to handle imbalanced data and applied hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance. As a result, our models achieved high precision and F1 scores, enabling accurate predictions of enrollment across various stages of the admissions process. These insights will help us proactively improve the admissions experience and foster stronger connections with prospective students.

## Project 2:
### Abstract:
The MyVoice Student Experience Survey seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities of Bucknell students’ classroom and out-of-classroom experiences and is a repository of data that Bucknell University can use to make improvements and drive change. The MyVoice 2022 survey provides students with ample opportunity to provide feedback in the areas of satisfaction; community; well-being; safety and security; dining and housing; study abroad; freedom of expression; and diversity and inclusion. The online survey was sent to 3,777 undergraduates, with a total of 2,390 students participating in the survey, representing a 63% response rate. Throughout the research project our team has developed a process leveraging generative AI to help efficiently code the vast number of survey responses. This iterative process involves constructing and continuously refining codebooks to better categorize major themes from questions including: how to improve the student experience (Q1.5), strengthen campus community (Q2.3), and
enhance the housing selection process (Q2.5). By following this process our team was able to produce strong metrics and hopefully aid different Bucknell committees and board
members to create a better campus and university experience for future Bucknellians.
